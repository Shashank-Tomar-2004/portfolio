# Zorin OS - Interactive Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive portfolio. This project showcases my skills not just through a list of projects, but through a dynamic, hands-on experience. On a desktop, it's a faithful re-creation of the Zorin OS environment. On a mobile device, it intelligently transforms into a sleek, native-feeling mobile UI.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up the Project Locally

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have `npm` (which comes with Node.js) and `git` installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/shashank-tomar-2004/portfolio.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```
    cd portfolio
    ```

3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    To use the AI features, you'll need to create a local environment file to store your Gemini API key.
    *   Create a new file in the root of the project named `.env.local`.
    *   Inside this file, add the following line, replacing `your_gemini_api_key` with your actual key from Google AI Studio:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
        ```

5.  **Start the development server:**
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    The application will now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üö¢ Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment on **Vercel**.

1.  Push your code to your GitHub repository.
2.  Import your repository into Vercel.
3.  In the Vercel project settings, add the following environment variable:
    *   **Name:** `GEMINI_API_KEY`
    *   **Value:** `your_gemini_api_key` (The same key you used in your `.env.local` file)
4.  Deploy! Vercel will automatically handle the rest, including the serverless function in the `api` directory.
